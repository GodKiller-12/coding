# 🧠 Coding Practice – DSA & LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my `coding` repository!  
This is where I document my journey of solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, mainly from **LeetCode**, and other competitive programming platforms. This repo helps me stay consistent, track progress, and revise efficiently.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The solutions are grouped by topic or platform, like this:


Each file is named by problem or topic. Most include comments for clarity and explanations of the approach.

---

## 💻 Language Used

> **C++** (Only)  
I use C++ STL (Standard Template Library) for cleaner, faster implementations.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Arrays and Strings  
- Hashing (Maps, Sets)  
- Two Pointers, Sliding Window  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees and Graphs (DFS, BFS)  
- Recursion and Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (DP)  
- Greedy Algorithms  
- Binary Search and Bit Manipulation  
- And more as I explore...
